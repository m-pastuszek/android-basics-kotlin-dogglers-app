Dogglers - App based on Android Developers CodeLabs
==================================
At Google, we affectionately call our coworkers Googlers. With many Googlers owning dogs as pets, we thought it would be fun to create an app for our canine friends, called Dogglers.
Your task is to implement Dogglers, which shows scrolling lists of Googlers' pet dogs along with a bit of information about each one, such as their name, age, hobbies, and a photo. 
In this project, you'll build layouts for the RecyclerView items in the Dogglers app, and implement an adapter so that the list of dogs can be presented three ways: by horizontal scrolling, vertical scrolling, and vertically scrolling grid layout.

Second independent project for [Android Basics in Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/course).

This project is an opportunity for you to demonstrate the concepts you learned in the unit.
